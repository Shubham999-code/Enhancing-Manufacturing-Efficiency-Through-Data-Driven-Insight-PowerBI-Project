In this project We analyze 'Manufacturing Production Data' for product details and costs, and 'Employee Performance Metrics' for workforce insights, aiming to enhance manufacturing efficiency and employee productivity at ProManu Analytics.

# Background

You are a data analyst at ProManu Analytics, a consultancy firm specializing in manufacturing analytics. Your team has been provided with two datasets: 'Manufacturing Production Data' and 'Employee Performance Metrics'. The 'Manufacturing Production Data' dataset encapsulates detailed information about various products, including production dates, costs, quantities, and warehouse locations. The 'Employee Performance Metrics' dataset offers insights into the workforce, covering departments, salaries, performance ratings, and countries of operation.

In a manufacturing landscape where efficiency, cost management, and employee performance are intricately linked, your analytical expertise is essential. Your challenge is to explore these datasets to identify trends and insights that could streamline manufacturing processes, optimize resource allocation, and enhance employee productivity.

# Objective

Your mission is to utilize Tableau's robust capabilities to craft a compelling narrative from the provided datasets. This task will encompass thorough data preparation, intelligent data modeling, and the skillful application of calculated fields and Tableau functions for sophisticated analysis. The ultimate aim is to construct an interactive and intuitive dashboard in Tableau that showcases your key discoveries, offering concise, actionable insights into the optimization of hotel operations and performance.
